Make real graphics:
    folder organization:
        pieces
        |
        +-- gamemode_name (classic)
            +-- piece_name  (S|Z|I|T|J|L|O)
                +-- tile_0.png
                +-- tile_1.png     (the numbers index which piece is there)
                or 
                +-- tile_all.png   (if all of the tiles are the same)


The sticky tetris seems to have a bug / glitch now

Make a menu item that is for viewing tetriminos (with an index number inside each tile), etc

Whenever a bug is fixed, keep that record, and then replay it (not graphically but simulated internally) to ensure no regressions

make the cell values u64s, and allow any type to be stored in them that can be converted to / from u64

Implement scoring for everything

When holding down the fall button, some double falls occur due to gravity.  have the fall button reset 
    its counter whenever an actual gravity fall happens, 
    or when the button is held down, disable gravity unless gravity is greater falling rate
    or when the button is held down, have the gravity function return double gravity rate or something

When fall or fastfall is pressed during a lock step, right as the piece is being placed, it leads to the fastfall being 
    applied to the next piece (so it falls right away)
        either add a visual indicator (so you can see the lock step, and when its about to expire)
        or, ignore fastfalls that happen for a few frames after lock step ends

Make fusion have full cascade rules, so the pieces each have their own values
Make cascade tetris check for overflowing values and then auto recalculate all active values back from 0

The lock delay needs to be reset whenever the current active tetrimino is switched
    -- this seems to be fixed
